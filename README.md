## Interests
While I am most familiar and comfortable with back-end development, I am actively working on improving my front-end skills. Additionally, I have a keen interest in IoT and home automation, with experience in working with Arduinos and other single-board microcontrollers.

I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and take on new challenges. Currently, I'm delving into PaperMC / Spigot development to broaden my expertise in game server programming.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!
